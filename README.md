# spirograph-
In this program, we define the draw_spirograph() function, which takes the radii of the inner and outer circles, as well as the distance between their centers, as parameters. The function then uses these parameters to calculate the position of the turtle and draw the spirograph.

The program prompts the user to enter the spirograph parameters, as well as the pen color and width, using the input() function. It then calls the draw_spirograph() function with the user input parameters.

Finally, the program allows the user to save the image using the getcanvas().postscript() function.

You can customize this code further by adding more options for the user to choose from, such as the number of rotations or the number of points to draw, or by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter.
